                <h3>Target Audience</h3>
                <p id="description"><strong>The target audience</strong> works most for those people who like to go on outdoor activities, and for those who need to drive around and want to know if the weather is good enough, however it will work for those who want to travel to a place where the main reason is, for example, to enjoy the beach. Or for the people who plan on flying somewhere and would never fly in bad conditions for being afraid. More over, if you have you clothes hung outside and need a confirmation to know whether your button up shirt is gonna be wet in case you need to do grocery, you may also be welcome.</p>
                <p><strong>Ocupation: </strong>Athletes, drivers, airport employees, business people and every one who wants to take advantage of such information.</p>

                <h3>Scenarios</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Scenario 1 - The app name is Washington State Weather, does it only work in Washington?"</h4>
                        <p>No. It has this name because it was first created in Washington. Its beta version was tested in Washington and we were able to test under different circumstances like snow, rain, sun and windy. So it was named after the state that provided such conditions.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Scenario 2 - It is easy to remove WSW from my phone if I want?</h4>
                        <p>Yes. We made it easy to install and uninstall so that you can remove and download again anytime you want, no tricks. Although it's a light app, we understand that it may not be a priority for some people to leave it on the phone.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Scenario 3 - My skill on phone is limited, is WSW simple to use?</h4>
                        <p>Its interface is really simple to use, we have a "help" link that works really well though.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Scenario 4 - How accurate is the information provided by WSW?</h4>
                        <p>Weather is always changing, however, the app is very accurate since we take in information from many other sources around the world.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Scenario 5 - Does WSW gives information 1 month ahead?</h4>
                        <p>It gives information within 30 days, however, the most accurate information is within 7 days.</p>
